# Contributing to Hashgraph

This project is in the nascent stages of development, as such, we are still working on our establishing our processes.  
Presently we’re inviting anyone who wants to be involved to join the [Hedera Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/FFb9YFX)
channel to discuss ideas around API’s and client libraries.  While this project is not directly supported by Hedera Hashgraph,
we feel it has the potential to be an important addition to the community, and presently, the developer community communicates 
in this forum.  At some point in the future as the project grows we will start forming a more formal process and document it
here; but for now, we’re all on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/FFb9YFX).  Thank You.
